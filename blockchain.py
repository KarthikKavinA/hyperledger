### Hyperledger Fabric ###

	* open source enterprise-grade permissioned distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform.
	* established under the Linux Foundation (Open Governance).
	* has a highly modular and configurable architecture.
	* first DLT to support smart contracts authored in general-purpose programming languages such as Java, Go and Node.js.
	* support for pluggable consensus protocols that enable the platform to be more effectively customized to fit particular 		  use cases and trust models.
	* can leverage consensus protocols that do not require a native cryptocurrency to incent costly mining or to fuel smart 	  contract execution.
	* enables confidentiality through its channel architecture and private data feature.
	
	
	
	
### Modular Components in Fabric ###
	* pluggable ordering service
		--- establishes consensus on the order of transactions and then broadcasts blocks to peers.
	* pluggable membership service provider
		--- is responsible for associating entities in the network with cryptographic identities.
	* optional peer-to-peer gossip service
		--- disseminates the blocks output by ordering service to other peers.
	* Smart contracts
		--- run within a container environment (e.g. Docker) for isolation and can be written in standard programming langs
	* ledger
		--- can be configured to support a variety of DBMSs.
	* pluggable endorsement and validation policy enforcement
		--- can be independently configured per application. 
	
	
		
### New Approach in Fabric ###
	* Replacing order-execute fashion with execute-order-validate model.
	* execute a transaction and check its correctness, thereby endorsing it,
	* order transactions via a (pluggable) consensus protocol, and
	* validate transactions against an application-specific endorsement policy before committing them to the ledger.
	* first phase (1st point) also eliminates any non-determinism, as inconsistent results can be filtered out before ordering
	
	
	
	
### Performance of Fabric ###
	* Performance of a blockchain platform can be affected by many variables such as transaction size, block size, network 		  size, as well as limits of the hardware, etc.
	* The latest scaled Fabric to 20,000 transactions per second.



### Choosing Pluggable Consensus Protocol ###
	* when deployed within a single enterprise, or operated by a trusted authority,
		--- crash fault-tolerant (CFT) consensus protocol might be more than adequate
	*  in a multi-party, decentralized use case,
		--- a more traditional byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol might be required.
		
		
		
		
### Application-Specific Endorsement Policy ###
	* specifies which peer nodes, or how many of them, need to vouch for the correct execution of a given smart contract.
	* each transaction need only be executed (endorsed) by the subset of the peer nodes necessary to satisfy the transactionâ€™s 		  endorsement policy.
		
		
		
### Smart Contracts ###
	* business logic of a blockchain application.
	* functions as a trusted distributed application.
	* many smart contracts run concurrently in the network
	* they may be deployed dynamically (in many cases by anyone)
	* application code should be treated as untrusted, potentially even malicious.
	*
	
	
	
	
### Channels ###
	*  participants on a Fabric network establish a sub-network where every member has visibility to a particular set of 		   transactions.
	*  only those nodes that participate in a channel have access to the smart contract (chaincode) and data transacted, 		   preserving the privacy and confidentiality of both.
	
	
	
	
### Private Data Collection ###
	* It is a collection (like DB) between members on a channel, allowing much of the same protection as channels without the 		  maintenance overhead of creating and maintaining a separate channel.
	
	
	
	
### Ordering Service ###
	* currently offering a CFT ordering service implementation based on the *etcd* library of the Raft protocol.
	* network can have multiple ordering services (like CFT or BFT in same n/w) supporting different applications or 		  application requirements. (Note this point: which is different from multiple orderer organizations having orderers like 	    CFT1,CFT2,etc for a single ordering service like CFT for a single application requirements.)
















### Justification ###
	* Confidentiality in Fabric N/W:
	* one approach    - Encrypting data -- Given enough time and computational resource, the encryption could be broken.
	* second approach - Zero knowledge proofs (ZKP) -- computing a ZKP requires considerable time and computational resources. 								   Hence, the trade-off in this case is performance.










### Topics ###
	* Determinism --- Smart Contracts:
	* Smart contracts executing in a blockchain that operates with the order-execute architecture must be deterministic; 		  otherwise, consensus might never be reached. To address the non-determinism issue, many platforms require that the smart 		  contracts be written in a non-standard, or domain-specific language (such as Solidity) so that non-deterministic     		  operations can be eliminated. This hinders wide-spread adoption because it requires developers writing smart contracts 		  to learn a new language and may lead to programming errors.
